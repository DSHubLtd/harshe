🧩 Guidelines for Addressing Semantic Conflicts in Harshe Dataset

When contributing text or transcriptions, it’s important to maintain semantic consistency to avoid confusion for both the models and human users. Here are our rules:

1. Context-Based Meaning Resolution

Words in Hausa can have multiple meanings depending on context (e.g., “gari” can mean town or powder/flour).

Always annotate/transcribe based on sentence-level context, not isolated words.

Example:

“Na tafi gari.” → “I went to town.”

“Na saya garin masara.” → “I bought maize flour.”

2. Dialect Awareness

Hausa is spoken with regional variations (e.g., Kano Hausa vs. Sokoto Hausa vs. Niger Hausa).

Contributors must tag dialects in metadata if the meaning of a word differs.

Example:

“kwarya” can mean calabash in some dialects, but plate in others.

Metadata Tag: "dialect": "Kano"

3. Standardization vs. Local Usage

Default to standard Hausa orthography (as approved by the Hausa Language Board).

If a word has strong local variants, record both forms with annotations.

Example:

Standard: mota (car)

Variant: karfe (used in some Niger regions for vehicle)

4. Polysemy and Homonyms

If a word has two or more distinct meanings, clarify in the dataset with semantic tags.

Example:

“kifi” → "fish (animal)" → Tag: "meaning": "animal"

“kifi” → "fish (food)" → Tag: "meaning": "food"

5. Borrowed / Loanwords

Hausa has many loanwords from Arabic, English, and French.

When a conflict arises between Hausa-native and loanword usage, include both forms with metadata.

Example:

asibiti (Hausa for hospital)

ospital (borrowed from English/French)

6. Semantic Conflict Resolution Process

When unsure:

Check Hausa dictionaries or linguistic resources.

Verify with native speakers from multiple regions.

Add comments/notes in metadata explaining why a certain choice was made.

If unresolved, submit as a semantic issue in GitHub Discussions for community consensus.

7. Metadata Example for Semantics
{
  "sentence": "Na tafi gari.",
  "translation": "I went to town.",
  "dialect": "Standard Kano",
  "meaning_tag": "location",
  "notes": "Word 'gari' used in locational context, not 'flour'."
}

8. Reviewer Responsibility

All dataset submissions go through peer-review by linguists and community validators.

Semantic inconsistencies will be flagged, corrected, or documented before merging into the main dataset.
