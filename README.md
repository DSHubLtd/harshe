# 🌍 The Harshe Project – Open ASR & TTS for Hausa Language  

### 🗣️ Giving Hausa a Voice in the Digital Age  

The **Harshe Project** is an open-source initiative to build **speech recognition (ASR)** and **text-to-speech (TTS)** systems for the Hausa language – one of the most spoken African languages, with over **70 million speakers** across Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Chad, and beyond.  

## ✨ Why Harshe?  
Language is not just communication – it is **identity, culture, and heritage**. Yet, millions of Hausa speakers are excluded from AI-driven opportunities because most modern speech technologies ignore African languages.  

Harshe is here to change that. By combining **technology + community + culture**, we will build **the largest Hausa speech dataset** and train powerful **AI models** that understand and speak Hausa naturally.  

## 🚀 Our Goals  
- Create an **open dataset** of Hausa speech (voices from men, women, children, elders, and multiple dialects).  
- Train **ASR models** to transcribe Hausa speech into text.  
- Build **TTS voices** that sound natural, inclusive, and representative of Hausa communities.  
- Provide **APIs & tools** so that startups, developers, and researchers can integrate Hausa voice technology into apps, education, fintech, health, and more.  

## 🤝 Call for Collaboration  
We can’t do this alone. We’re calling on:  
- **Data Scientists & ML Engineers** – help build and optimize models.  
- **Software Developers** – build APIs and apps to deploy Harshe.  
- **Voice Artists & Communities** – record authentic Hausa voices.  
- **Linguists** – guide phonetic accuracy and dialect coverage.  
- **Researchers & Innovators** – explore use cases across education, fintech, health, and governance.  

## 🌐 Join the Movement  
This project belongs to the **Hausa people and Africa at large**. Together, we can ensure that African languages are not left behind in the digital revolution.
