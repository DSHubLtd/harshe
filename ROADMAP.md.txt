🛤️ Harshe Project Roadmap

The Harshe Project is a massive open-source initiative to build state-of-the-art ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) systems for Hausa and other West African languages.
Our mission is to empower millions of speakers through AI-driven language tools that support education, healthcare, fintech, accessibility, and public services.

📅 Phase 1: Dataset Collection (Months 1–6)

✅ Launch community call for speech and text dataset contributions.

✅ Build crowdsourcing platform for voice recordings (web & mobile).

✅ Partner with universities, NGOs, and radio stations across West Africa.

✅ Collect 500+ hours of transcribed Hausa speech across dialects.

✅ Gather 5M+ words of text data (news, folktales, government docs, etc.).

✅ Annotate metadata: speaker age, gender, dialect, environment.

📅 Phase 2: Baseline Models (Months 6–12)

Train first baseline ASR model using open-source frameworks (ESPnet, Hugging Face, OpenSeq2Seq).

Develop baseline TTS voices (male & female).

Release v1 Hausa Speech Corpus (CC-BY license).

Publish technical report & benchmark results.

Organize first Harshe Hackathon to encourage usage and improvements.

📅 Phase 3: Expansion & Collaboration (Year 2)

Scale dataset to 2,000+ hours of diverse Hausa speech.

Add other West African languages (Fulfulde, Kanuri, Yoruba, Igbo, etc.).

Collaborate with governments & education ministries for official use.

Release Harshe API for developers (speech-to-text & text-to-speech).

Engage startups in fintech, healthtech, and edtech to integrate Harshe.

Publish research papers in top AI/ML/NLP conferences.

🌍 Impact Goals

Digital Inclusion: Enable Hausa speakers to interact with technology in their native language.

Education: Translate and narrate learning content for schools & e-learning.

Healthcare: Build ASR tools for health information systems & accessibility.

Economic Growth: Empower startups with localized speech technologies.

Culture Preservation: Digitize and preserve oral traditions, stories, and dialects.

🤝 How to Get Involved

Data Contributors: Submit speech & text data (see DATASET_GUIDE.md).

Researchers: Train and benchmark ASR/TTS models.

Developers: Build apps with Harshe APIs.

Organizations: Partner with us for impact in education, health, and public services.

🚀 Together, we will give Hausa and African languages a powerful voice in the digital age.
