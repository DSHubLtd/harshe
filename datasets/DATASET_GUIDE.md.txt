📊 DATASET_GUIDE.md – Harshe Project

Welcome to the Harshe Project Dataset Contribution Guide!
We are collecting and building the largest open-source Hausa Speech & Text Dataset to power ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) models.

Your contributions will directly help Hausa-speaking communities gain access to modern AI tools for education, healthcare, fintech, and public services.

🎙️ How to Contribute Speech Data
1. Recording Voice Data

Language: Hausa (with dialects such as Kano, Sokoto, Katsina, Zaria, Bauchi, Niger, etc.).

Duration: Each clip should be 5–15 seconds long.

Environment: Quiet background, avoid noise/music.

Steps:

Read aloud clearly and naturally.

Save files as:

Upload to the project’s dataset folder or via the shared Google Drive/OSF link.

2. Spontaneous Speech Collection

We also need real conversations, radio clips, stories, interviews.

Transcribe what was said in Hausa.

Label speaker turns if multiple people.

Note the dialect if identifiable.
