🌍 What Is Harshe?

Harshe is a large-scale open-source initiative focused on:

📊 Dataset collection

🗣️ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS)

🧠 Semantic-aware language modeling

Our mission is to build high-quality Hausa language resources that reflect real usage, dialect diversity, and cultural context.

🧩 Who Can Contribute?

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds:

🎙️ Voice recording & voice-over professionals

📚 Linguists & language experts

📊 Data analysts & annotators

🤖 AI / ML engineers

💻 Software developers

🧑🏽‍🏫 Educators & researchers

No contribution is too small.

📂 Types of Contributions

You can contribute by submitting:

Text data (sentences, phrases, dialogues)

Audio recordings (Hausa speech)

Transcriptions (audio → text)

Translations (Hausa ↔ English)

Semantic annotations

Code, tools, or scripts

🧠 Semantic Guidelines (VERY IMPORTANT)

Hausa contains many ambiguous words (semantic conflicts).
Example:

Word	Possible Meanings
gari	town / flour
kasa	land / country
ruwa	water / liquid
hanya	road / method

👉 Every contribution must clarify meaning using context.
