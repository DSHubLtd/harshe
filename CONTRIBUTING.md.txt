📘 CONTRIBUTING.md – Harshe Project

Welcome to the Harshe Project!
We’re building open-source ASR (speech-to-text) and TTS (text-to-speech) tools for Hausa – one of Africa’s most widely spoken languages. This is a community-powered initiative, and every contribution counts.

This is a community-driven open-source initiative to build state-of-the-art ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) for Hausa and other West African languages.

Your contributions—whether code, datasets, research, or ideas—will directly empower millions of speakers and support digital inclusion across Africa.

Thank you for considering joining us in this historic journey.

🌍 🛠️ How You Can Contribute

We need contributors from different backgrounds and skills. Pick your role:

1. Data Collection & Voice Recording

Record your voice reading Hausa sentences (we’ll provide scripts).

Contribute spontaneous speech (stories, conversations, radio snippets).

Annotate and validate recordings from others.

2. Data Cleaning & Annotation

Clean raw text (remove errors, normalize Hausa orthography).

Align speech with transcripts.

Tag dialects, speaker age, and gender when possible.

3. Linguistics Support

Help with Hausa phonetics and dialect variations.

Validate tone markings, vowel length, and regional differences.

Provide linguistic resources, dictionaries, or glossaries.

4. AI/ML Engineering

Work on ASR pipelines (training, evaluation, WER reduction).

Train TTS voices using Tacotron, VITS, or other models.

Optimize models for mobile devices and low-resource settings.

5. Software Development

Build APIs and SDKs to deploy Hausa ASR/TTS.

Create apps and integration demos (education, fintech, health).

Maintain scripts, Dockerfiles, and CI/CD pipelines.

6. Community & Outreach

Translate project docs into Hausa and English.

Share the project with universities, media houses, and tech hubs.

Help organize meetups, workshops, and recordings.
